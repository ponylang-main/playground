# Change Log

All notable changes to the Pony compiler and standard library will be documented in this file. This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) and [Keep a CHANGELOG](http://keepachangelog.com/).

## [unreleased] - unreleased

### Fixed

- Link the correct version of `libponyrt` when compiling with `--pic` on Linux (issue #1359)

### Added

- Runtime function `pony_send_next`. This function can help optimise some message sending scenarios.

### Changed

## [0.7.0] - 2016-10-22

### Fixed

- Concatenate docstrings from case methods (issue #575).

### Added

- TCP read and write backpressure hooks in `TCPConnection` (issue #1311)
- Allow TCP notifiers to cause connections to yield while receiving (issue #1343)

### Changed

- `break` without a value now generates its value from the `else` branch of a loop instead of being an implicit `break None`.
- The `for` loop will now break out of the loop instead of continuing with the following iterations if `Iterator.next` errors.

## [0.6.0] - 2016-10-20

### Fixed

- Compiling ponyrt with Clang versions >= 3.3, < 3.6.
- Restrict mutable tuple recovery to maintain reference capability security (issue #1123)
- Crash in the runtime scheduler queues

### Added

- DTrace and SystemTap support - `use=dtrace`

### Changed

- Replaces `use=telemetry` by DTrace/SystemTap scripts
- `String.cstring()` now always returns a null-terminated string
  (which may result in a copy) while `cpointer()` (also available on
  `Array` objects) returns a pointer to the underlying array as-is
  (issue #1309).

## [0.5.1] - 2016-10-15

### Fixed

- `SSLConnection` ignoring the `sent` notifier method (issue #1268)
- Runtime crash in the runtime scheduler queues (issue #1319)

## [0.5.0] - 2016-10-09

### Fixed

- Memory copy bounds for `String.clone` (issue #1289).
- Security issues in `ProcessMonitor` (issue #1180)
- `SSLConnection` bugs due to missing `sentv` notify method (issue #1282)

### Added

- `Iter` class (issue #1267)
- read_until method on buffered.Reader (RFC 0013)
- `format` package (issue #1285)

### Changed

- HTML documentation for expanded union types now adds line breaks to improve readability (issue #1263)

## [0.4.0] - 2016-09-26

### Fixed

- Unexpected message ordering in `ProcessManager` (issue #1265)

### Added

- TCP writev performance improvement by avoiding throwing errors

### Changed

## [0.3.2] - 2016-09-18

### Fixed

- The `ponyc` version is now consistently set from the VERSION file.
- Stop generating `llvm.invariant.load` intrinsic for "let" references, as these don't necessarily match the semantics of that intrinsic.

### Changed

- The `setversion` and `release` commands have been removed from `Makefile`.
- LTO is again enabled by default on OSX
- make now builds a `release` rather than `debug` build by default

## [0.3.1] - 2016-09-14

- Account for both hyperthreading and NUMA locality when assigning scheduler threads to cores on Linux.
- Stop generating `llvm.invariant.start` intrinsic. It was causing various problems in code generation.
- Buffer overflow triggerable by very long `ponyc` filename (issue #1177).
